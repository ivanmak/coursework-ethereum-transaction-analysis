# Part A
------------
The requirement of this part was to calculate the total and average number of transactions on the Ethereum mainnet in each month, using MapReduce.

The MapReduce programmes produced were:
* [PartA_TransactionCount.py](PartA_TransactionCount.py) - Total number of transactions in each month
* [PartA_AverageTransactions.py](PartA_AverageTransactions.py) - Average number of transactions in each month
